## Adding content

This project uses [Nuxt.js Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/), a new module from the Nuxt team that allows for the easy asynchronous fetching and displaying of Markdown, JSON, YAML, and CSV files which acts as a headless CMS.

All content (blog posts in our case) is located in the `content` directory.

#### Front Matter

We utilize YAML front matter as specified by the [Content docs](https://content.nuxtjs.org/writing).

Our front matter looks like this:

```
---
title: Title of the blog post
description: Description of the blog post
author: John Deere
category: Github
image: /image.jpg
---
```

Things to note:

-   `category` must begin with an uppercase letter, unless some minor code changes are made.
-   `image` is a relative path that must include `/` unless minor code changes are made to include the option to allow full path URLs.
-   You can add any additional objects here for use in your posts.

The above YAML front matter will inject the following variables:

```
{
  body: Object
  title: "Title of the blog post"
  description: "Description of the blog post"
  image: "/image.jpg"
  author: "John Deere"
  category: "Github"
  dir: "/"
  extension: ".md"
  path: "/name-of-file"
  slug: "name-of-file"
  toc: Array
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

Things to note:

-   All variables are accessible in components by fetching the data, storing it in a variable, and accessing `variable.title`. For example that would return `"Title of the blog post"` in this case.
-   Some of the variables are automatically generated by Nuxt Content.
-   The name of the markdown file, in our case a blog post, is what generates the `slug` and `path`. For example a blog post named `hello-world.md` would inject `slug: "name-of-file"` and `path: "/name-of-file"`.
