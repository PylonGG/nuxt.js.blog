Today we are officially releasing the Pylon blog, this blog will serve as a messenger from our development team to anyone who is curious regarding the development and design of Pylon.

## What is Pylon?

Not to repeat the title of the post, but it sums it up as good as anyone ever will be able to. Pylon is a gaming and technology based discussion platform.

### Interesting, so it is just a clone of X, Y, or Z?

No, it is not a clone of any existing social media platform. We believe that with our core content aggregation framework we can provide a better experience for creating and viewing content that matters most to _you_.

This begins with our core philosophies for content on Pylon:

-   Usability
-   Searchability
-   Browsability

### 1. Usability

Our entire team is gamers at heart, and games are fun. We want using our platform to be fun and engaging and we currently are on track to nail that goal.

Why can't an in-depth discussion about a specific game mechanic or argument about which current JavaScript framework is the best be fun after all?

We believe it can, and we will make sure that it is.

Creating and consuming content should be fun and engaging, and you should also have a better way to get your content across.

### 2. Searchability

Can you believe that this is apparently actually a word? Searchability, interesting.

One of the biggest problems with most social media platforms today is that a lot of the content, context, and information is completely swamped and buried.

This is one of the reasons why many have magnificent memories of forums. You were able to follow discussions and topics with ease, and whenever you found yourself lost or needing to figure something out the ability to search was miles better than current solutions.

As a creator and as a consumer, we understand these issues matter to you. Getting your content found is the first step to gaining traction in your specific area, and getting to the content you want will be just as important.

### 3. Browsability

We believe this is the single biggest factor that will set Pylon apart from anything else seen before.

Without going into to much detail now, we all find ourselves at times getting lost in "that part" of YouTube. A quick video search turns into hours of laughs, questions, and some of the strangest things known to mankindâ€”and it is awesome!

The ability to browse and find new and exciting content that interests you, or even find something interesting that you never would have had experience with before is a core component of what makes Pylon unique.

## When can we expect to see Pylon release

That is a great question, and we are not completely sure but we are currently aiming for closed beta in the following months, and a Q3 2020 official launch.

Be sure to keep checking back, or if you are interested sign up for an exclusive chance to be a closed beta tester on the home page of the blog (or navigation bar if you are on mobile).
